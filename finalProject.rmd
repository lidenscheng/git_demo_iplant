This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
setwd("/home/lidenscheng/Git_demo/") #setwd: set working directory
data.in <- read.delim(file = "./output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", sep="\t")
Afghanistan <- subset(data.in, country=="Afghanistan")
China <- subset(data.in, country=="China")
Japan <- subset(data.in, country=="Japan")
afghanPlot <- ggplot(Afghanistan, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap))+geom_point()
chinaPlot <- ggplot(China, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap))+geom_point()
japanPlot <- ggplot(Japan, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap))+geom_point()

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
